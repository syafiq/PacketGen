Packet Generator for troubleshooting telecom networks.

Currently works well only for diameter protocol. <br />
There is a feature to change AVP inside diameter application.<br /> 
<br />
To change the AVP value, the following parameter on the configuration file should be configured :<br />
input_code -> AVP number<br />
input_value -> The new value of AVP number above (in hex)<br />
<br />
On progress development for radius and http support. <br />
