# PacketGen
Packet Generator for troubleshooting telecom networks.

Currently works well only for diameter protocol.
There is a feature to change AVP inside diameter application. 

To change the AVP value, the following parameter on the configuration file should be configured :
input_code -> AVP number
input_value -> The new value of AVP number above (in hex)

currently on progress development for radius and http support.
